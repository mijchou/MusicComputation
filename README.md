Music Cognition and Generation
==============================

## Introduction

In order to compute music with statistical/analytical models, this repository draws attention to *Music Cognition* and *Music Generation* at the *symbolic* level (as opposed to the *audio* level, where the sound sourced from actual performance is analysed.) We decompose the way music is perceived and recognised, into symbolic pieces such as *rhythm*, *metrics*, *pitch* and *harmony*. Relevant resources incluing books, journals and toolkits are collected and may be found in
