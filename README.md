Music Cognition and Generation
==============================

## Introduction

There have been several ways in literature to let machine generate, or more specifically *comepose*, music. This repository draws attention to *Music Cognition* at the *symbolic* level (as opposed to the *audio* level, where the sound sourced from actual performance is analysed.) This approach deposes the way music is perceived and recognised, into symbolic pieces such as *rhythm*, *metrics*, *pitch* *harmony* and so on.

Relevant resources incluing books, journals and toolkits are collected and may be found in
